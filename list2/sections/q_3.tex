\section{Question 3}
The water level remains constant because every time a drop of water comes out from the left and the buoy lowers, it causes a drop of water to enter from above and the buoy to rise again. This behavior is cyclical and is a characteristic of the mechanical system. Therefore, considering the water level as a control variable, the closed-loop system is stable.
